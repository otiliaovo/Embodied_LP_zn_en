# Abstract 

## Abstract emotional language embodiment in L1 Chinese and L2 English: a valence-space association study based on a web-based vertical paradigm"

<p align = 'justify'>
The valence-space metaphor ("positive is up; negative is down'') assumes that human emotions are comprehended by being mapped onto the spatial dimension. Previous research on the embodiment of affective language has mainly used word stimuli in experiments requiring the participants to respond by making vertical hand movements in response to emotion words. Our aim is to study figurative emotional language embodiment in the two languages of bilingual participants by investigating whether the spatial aspect of verticality will be available online while the participants are comprehending affective metaphors. We conducted three experiments in a web-based vertical paradigm with Chinese-English bilinguals. In Experiment 1 and 3 the participants read affective metaphorical sentences in their native (e.g. 你漫步云端) and second language (e.g. You hit rock bottom), and performed upward or downward mouse movements. To check if the L1 has an effect on L2 processing, the stimuli in Experiment 2 were English sentences containing metaphors that have a lexical and conceptual equivalent in Chinese. We found a reversed valence-space congruency effect in the participants’ L1, which we interpret as evidence of embodiment. We also observed shorter reaction and movement times in the bilinguals’ L2 in response to positive sentences than to negative sentences, with an additional facilitation in the up response direction. Taken together, the findings confirm emotional embodiment in L1 processing and a delayed access to the spatial aspect of the metaphor for positive sentences only in L2 processing.

# Conclusion
<p align = 'justify'>
We conclude that the bilingual participants in our study embody the valence-space metaphor in their L1, i.e., they access the spatial aspect of the metaphor automatically, as manifested in their response times to valenced sentences. In their L2, access to the spatial aspect is delayed and limited to positive statements.
